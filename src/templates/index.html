		<p>We believe that organic cotton is not only the best choice for the environment, but for your baby too.</p>
	
		<p>We provide products which are organic and ethically made. We choose to use EarthPositive garments, each of which is made from organic cotton. They are manufactured solely using sustainable energy generated from wind and solar power. Each garment is then screen printed by hand in our Tunbridge Wells studio, using environmentally friendly water-based inks.</p>
		
		<p>Our packaging is 100% recycled.</p>

		<p>Available to buy from <a href="http://racheloriel.com" target="_blank">RachelOriel.com</a>.</p>
